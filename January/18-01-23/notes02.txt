basic selector:
1.element selector (elementname)
2.id - (#)
3.class - (.)
4.universal - (*)
5.grouping - (,)
combinator selector: - relationship between two tags
1.descendant (space) - parent/child/grandchild tags
2.child (>)  - parent/child tags
3.adjacent siblings (+) -->brother/sister/first tags
4.general siblings (~) -->brother/sister/all tags
pseudo-elements
1.before (::before) - it will add content from css to html before the text of that particular tag.
2.after (::after) - it will add content at the last position opposite of before pseudo elements.
3.selection (::selection)-is is use to hightlight the content of the web page
pseudo-class
pseudo-class-basic - (mainly in input tag)
1.focus  - (input:focus)
2.required - (input:required)
pseudo-class-anchor (mainly in anchor tag)
1.link - (a:link) ->currenlty newly link elements
1.active - (a:active) ->once you press the mouse
2.visited - (a:visited) ->already you visted this page
3.hover - (a:hover) ->mouse over
pseudo-class-general -(mostly used with li tags)
1.first-child - (li:first-child) first element in the list will have the changing of color
2.nth-child (li:nth-child(2n)) --> remember this one
//2n - for even number
//2n+1 - for odd number
3.nth-of-type  - both nth-child and nth-of-type will work in same way.
//nth-child - will conside all siblings as their own element and it will give you the wrong result.
//nth-of-type- always it will consider the exact siblins element.
4.nth-last-child -(li:nth-last-child(2n)) -> opposite of nth-child
==============================================
attributes selectors
1.general attribute selector
//it will apply for any attribute inside the html tag
//syntax
//we need to use html tag after that square bracket.
//inside the square bracket we need to give attribute name.
//example:
  input[type]{
    border:10px solid green;
  }
2.attribute with matching value selector
//specific value matches will apply the color
example:
 input[type=“text”]{
    border:10px solid green;
  }
3.attribute with starting value (^)
//anything that start with that character then it will apply the color
<style>
            li[id^=“ac”]{
                color:red;
            }
</style>
4.attribute with ending value ($)
//anything that ends with this particular keyword it is going to apply the color
<style>
          li[id$=“ac”]{
                color:red;
            }
</style>
5.attribute anywhere matching value (*)
//anywhere if it matches the particular symbol it will apply the color
<style>
          li[id*=“ac”]{
                color:red;
            }
</style>
6.attribute selector with pipe symbol - (|)
//it is going to match starting keyword matching with our given word alone with hyphen
//hyphen should be after the word
       <style>
            li[id|=“ac”]{
                color:red;
            }
        </style>
 <li  id=“ac-lag”>Eraser</li>
7.attribute selector with tilde symbol (~)
//anywhere in the text it should be separate keyword
 <style>
            li[id~=“ac”]{
                color:red;
            }
        </style>
  <li id=“two ac”>sharpner</li>
