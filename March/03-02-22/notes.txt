Lexical environment
scope chaining 
hoisting
execution context
============================
first class function:
//function is called by his key not by function name.
//best example you can take it from object.
//if function is treated as variables is called first class function.
=============================
Higher order function:
//Higer order is nothing but function is returning one more function.
===============================================
Javascript Engine:
//our entire code will excute inside the call stack 
//call stack will work LIFO.
example:
var a = 10;
var b =  20;
var c = a + b;
console.log(c);

Context:
//Inside the javascript for each function context will be created
//Inside the context you will have local memory and working code.
//First inside the call stack global execution context will be created for you.
//Global execution you will have all function name and variable registered there.
//Because of global execution context hoisting is possible.

lexical environment:
//local memory + parent function access.

scope chaining:
For any variable what is the scope. From where to where we can access any variable or function.
//scope chaining is possible because of lexical environment.
